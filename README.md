# Simualted-Library-Project
This is my final project for my Object Oriented Programming class, made in JavaFX. It simulates a library that allows people to create an account, sign in, take out/return books, customize their personal info, etc. It features a basic aesthetic inspired by Persona 5's menu UI, using slightly altered images from the game in some cases.

SUMMARY------------------
This is my final project I made two semesters ago for Object Oriented Programming
at Suffolk County Community College.

FEATURES-----------------
This simulates a library system that allows guests to browse books, users can log in
and take out/return books to the library and/or modify their personal info, and an 
Admin account can add/delete books from the library's collection as well as view every
user's information and what books are due and what books aren't. Users can also delete their
accounts entirely and guests can create accounts. The Admin account info is hard coded in, however.

It features a very basic form of password protection, pushing each character of the string
up by 10 when being stored, and reducing each character by 10 when checking to see what
the password in question actually is.

VISUALS------------------
The visuals of the library are basic, but are inspired from the video game Persona 5,
utilizing a red/black/white aesthetic as well as some (slightly adjusted) art from the
game itself.

COMMENTS-----------------
It was a slow start but it was fun to work on for hours on end while listneing to music.
